 * A <code>Closure</code> is a snippet of code that can access variables

 * Currently in Java, all variables accessed by the <code>Closure</code>
 * need to be marked as <code>final</code>.  To export information from
 * the <code>Closure</code> context to the context in which the
 * <code>Closure</code> is defined, consider using buffers such as
