/**
 * This class implements synchronous operations on message send to a switch. If
 * syncRequest is set to true, it sends the requested message to the switch
 * followed by a Barrier request message. It returns the result once it gets the
 * reply from the switch or after a timeout. If the protocol does not dictate
 * the switch to reply the processing status for a particular message, the
 * Barrier request forces the switch to reply saying whether or not the message
 * processing was successful for messages sent to the switch up to this point.
 * If syncRequest is false, it simply skips the message send and just waits for
 * the response back.
